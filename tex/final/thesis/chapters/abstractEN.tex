    We consider the problem of designing a low-complexity, model-free, output feedback controller to achieve output tracking with prescribed transient and steady-state performance, for the class of MIMO, high relative degree uncertain nonlinear systems in canonical form with bounded-input-bounded-state stable internal dynamics and external disturbances. The proposed controller utilizes the prescribed performance control me-thodology and high-gain observers. To avoid the propagation of the peaking phenomenon the developed controller is saturated without compromising the desirable closed-loop system performance characteristics. Simulation studies clarify and verify the approach.
